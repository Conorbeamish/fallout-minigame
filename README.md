A clone of the terminal hacking game in Fallout

====================================================

GAMEPLAY

Players are given a list of words and have 3 tries to select one word from the list which is pre-determined as the password.

The words are hidden in jumbled text and must be found and clicked to make a guess. 

After each selection the player is notified of how many letters of the selected word match the password in the correct place.

Players can select a harder difficulty which increases the length of the words.
